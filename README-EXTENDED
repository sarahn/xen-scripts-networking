These custom scripts add filtering of input to the domUs as well as
 ipv6 and mac antispoofing.

See network-bridge-extended and vif-bridge-extended for configuration options.
The default is for all filtering to be enabled.

After running, please verify your sysctl rules match the following:

$ /sbin/sysctl net.bridge
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables = 0

To use these scripts, in /etc/xen/xend-config.sxp replace

(network-script 'network-bridge')

with

(network-script 'network-bridge-extended')

Replace 

(vif-script 'vif-bridge')

with

(vif-script 'vif-bridge-extended')
